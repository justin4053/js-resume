                    <p>One of the setups in this software was to simulate the condition of chemicals stored in a tank. The setting process was very complicated, and each parameter would even interactively influence another one. Therefore, I used a process

                <p>During the whole project, we had a sprint review & planning meeting every 1-2 weeks with our client and had a quick stand-up meeting every morning to keep every teammate on the same page. This scrum development process effectively reduced
                    communication barriers. Overall, our client was quite satisfied with the collaboration and the out-coming results. The project was still in the development stage, and we all look forward to the final MVP.</p>
